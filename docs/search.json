We hope you leave the workshop able to say:\n\nR isn‚Äôt scary!\n\nWe also hope to show you you can use R to do things with data you‚Äôre already familiar with, as well as clinical computations.\nObject Types\nData Frames in R are like Datasets in SAS¬Æ\nData frames are made up of columns called ‚Äúvectors‚Äù ‚Äì treated like Variables in SAS¬Æ\nMore data types exist, but we‚Äôll focus on data frames Basic variable types:\nCharacter (\"A\")\nNumeric (100)\nBoolean (TRUE)\nOperators in R\nOperator\nMeaning\nExample\n==\nequal to\nx == y\n!=\nnot equal to\nx != y\n<\nless than\nx < y\n<=\nless than or equal to\nx <= y\n>\ngreater than\nx > y\n>=\ngreater than or equal to\nx >= y\n|\nor\nx | y\n&\nand\nx & y\n!\nnot\n!x\nThe Pipe %>% Operator\nWhat are packages?\nWhat is the tidyverse?\nWorking with Data Frames\nKeep/Drop/Rename\nSub-setting by rows (where)\nSorting\nset AKA bind_rows\n\nmerge AKA *_join\n\nDefining New Variables\nSummarizing Data\nWhere to Go From Here:\nWe mentioned a lot of amazing packages within the R ecosystem that we leverage every day. click on the package photo for more info and documentation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
