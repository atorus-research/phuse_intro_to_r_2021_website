The benefit of this is we can all use R with the same configurations, rather than setting up R on each operating system.\nTo log into the cloud use this link: www.TODO.com where you should be able to make a copy of the project for yourself.\nTODO: screenshot of this process?\nRun the Sample Code\nTODO: I‚Äôm pretty sure if everyone uses a fork of our cloud project they‚Äôll all have the libraries and stuff they need but maybe we can walk them through running a test file that will fail if they didn‚Äôt have the libraries installed/loaded?\n\n\n\n",
