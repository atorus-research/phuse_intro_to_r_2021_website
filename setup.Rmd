## The Cloud

During the workshop we will be using RStudio Cloud. The benefit of this is we can all use R with the same configurations, rather than setting up R on each operating system.

To log into the cloud use this link: www.TODO.com where you should be able to make a copy of the project for yourself. 

TODO: screenshot of this process?

## Run the Sample Code

TODO: I'm pretty sure if everyone uses a fork of our cloud project they'll all have the libraries and stuff they need but maybe we can walk them through running a test file that will fail if they didn't have the libraries installed/loaded?
